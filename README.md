# üöÄ Buildathon Scenario: ‚ÄúThe Oasis Protocol‚Äù

**üéÆ Theme:** *Inspired by the immersive universe of Ready Player One, where knowledge, and code are the keys to unlocking ultimate control.*

## üåê Scenario Background:

In the year 2045, the OASIS a vast virtual world, has gone dark. An anonymous force has encrypted the Master Key needed to reboot the system. Only the most skilled coders can decode the layers of security and unlock the final Builder Challenge to restore the OASIS to its former glory.

The only path forward lies in getting the control of the OASIS. Unlock the key of the OASIS and enhance your OASIS with the key.

Your team is the last hope. Crack the layers of security, rebuild the platform, and restore the OASIS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Your Task

1.	**Team Authentication**

    Design and implement a complete authentication layer for teams.
  
    üì¶ Deliverables:

    -	Team Sign-up: Teams register with a unique name.
    -	Login/Logout: Support authentication (ex: GitHub/Google, etc.). You are only required to implement one authentication method, and no extra marks for additional authentication methods.
    -	Access Control: Only authenticated teams can view challenges.
    -	On successful login, redirect to the algorithmic challenge interface for the hacker.

2.	**Admin Authentication**

    A secure admin login system distinct from the team portal.

    üì¶ Deliverables:

    -	Admin Login Page: With pre-defined credentials.
    -	Route Protection: Restrict admin-only pages via RBAC.
    -	Logout & Session Management: Clear admin sessions on logout or expiry.

3.	**Admin Dashboard**

    Overview for monitoring platform status and activity.

    üì¶ Deliverables:

    -	Dashboard with real-time or dynamic stats including:
        -	Registered team count
        -	Active challenges
        -	Total submissions
        -	Leaderboard snapshot\
    -	Consider charting or visual summaries for added usability.

4.	**Admin Challenge Management**

    A full interface for creating and managing challenges where each challenge consists of a algorithmic and buildathon problem.

    üì¶ Deliverables:
  	
      -	Create/Edit/Delete a Challenges: Each challenge consists of a algorithmic problem and a buildathon problem. The correct output of a algorithmic problem is the flag which will be submitted to unlock the buildathon problem.
      -	Create/Edit/Delete Algorithmic Problem.
      -	Create/Edit/Delete Buildathon Problem.
      -	Create/Delete Flag for the challenge

5.	**Admin Team Management**

    In this section, it should allow admins to view and interact with team data.

    üì¶ Deliverables:

    -	Team Listing: Display all teams with search/filter by name.
    -	Submission History: View all past submissions per team

6.	**Challenge Portal**

    In this portal, the added questions will be presented to team. First the algorithmic question will be presented. Once they solve it the answer should be submitted as the flag. Once the valid flag is submitted to the platform, the buildathon question will be revealed to the player. A zip file of the source code must be submitted to the platform to pass to the next challenge.

    üì¶ Deliverables:

    -	Algorithmic Challenge Page:
        -	Problem description with constraints
        -	Code editor (No need of syntax highlighting) and language selection
        -	Code Execution via integrated Judge0 CE API (Credentials are provided below)
        -	Display code output/error
        -	Display code execution status
    -	FLAG Submission & Validation:
        -	Submit the flag and validate to unlock the buildathon phase
    -	Buildathon Challenge Reveal:
        -	Display the buildathon task
        -	Teams must upload a Github link for the source code via submission interface

7.	**Team Leaderboard**
    
    Rank teams based on progress and time.

    üì¶ Deliverables:

    -	Leaderboard displaying:
        -	Team Name
        -	Total Points
      
8. **Submission**

    Once completed building, our team will provide a form where you have to submit the following:

    üì¶ Deliverables:

    - Youtube Link (Walkthrough Video of the platform)
    - Github Repo Link (Source code of the platform you've built)
